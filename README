####################################

Introduction
============

Kalbum is an application that allows you to create albums from a collection of images.

Main features:
    - Easy to use thumbnail interface
    - Export the albums as a complete web site, or .war web archive
    - Easy to edit html templates for creating a customized web site
    - Edit multiple images at once
    - Versatile gui
    - Original images remain unchanged
    - Drag'n'Drop

There's no documentation at the moment, but the program should be straightforward enough to use:
Add images from the interface or drag image files from a file manager. Edit them to describe them,
save the album then export to an html album as necessary.

Requirements:
KDE >= 3.0.1
QT  >= 3.0.3


Changes from version 0.7.4:
===========================

- added an option to export html as a single .war file
- added an option to include link to original images from generated html
- addded command line option to add images to a new album
- saves export dialog settings within an album
- vast speed increase for editing image details without the preview window being open
- clicking on the image's url now produces a requester for changing the image's location
- increased the number of thumbnails in html output to nine
- all fields within the details window can now modify all selected images
- added total and selected information to the status bar
- added a time field for the images
- re-coded a more versatile gui (dock widgets)
- changed html file extensions from .htm to .html
- added more image formats to file requesters
- added French translation by (for 0.7.4) Fabrice Belon
- added Spanish translation (for 0.8.0) by Miguel Revilla Rodríguez


Notes on this release
=====================

Editing multiple images at once is fairly straightforward. Only edited fields will be applied to the
selected images, with only the url working differently to single image mode. Changing the url with
more than one image selected changes the source directory for all selected images. Useful when a 
source dirctory has moved or changed.

The default html output has changed to use 9 thumbnails instead of the previous 6, but it's a bit 
tight and can cause problems with longer image titles. If you'd prefer to change back to 6 thumbnails, 
you need to edit two files:

	Navigate to kalbum's data directory. Mandrake 9 uses an install prefix of '/usr', 
	so the data directory is '/usr/share/apps/kalbum'. From here the html data is 
	'data/kalbum_html/folder' and the two files we need are gen_src.html and thm_src.html. 
	Open gen_src.html, this is the template for the album information page,
	<!-- {Kalbum Thumbs=0009} --> needs to be changed to <!-- {Kalbum Thumbs=0006} -->'. 
	Finally, open thm_src.html (the template for the thumbnails page) and remove the last 
	two rows of the table containing the thumbnails.
